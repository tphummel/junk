# Jigseer

Jigseer is a FrankenPHP + Caddy application for tracking collaborative jigsaw puzzle progress. The service is designed to run on a phone or tablet next to an in-progress physical puzzle so everyone can record their contributions as connections are made.

## Quick start

Spin up the latest prebuilt image from GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/tphummel/jigseer:latest
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/tphummel/jigseer:latest
```

Then visit http://localhost:8080 to create your first puzzle.

## Feature overview

- **Puzzle lifecycle** – create a puzzle with an optional total piece count and receive a short code for revisiting it later.
- **Play tab (`/p/{id}/play`)** – mobile-friendly buttons for each active player sorted by most recent hit, overall progress tracking, QR code for easy sharing, and a reminder banner when the total piece count is unknown.
- **Leaderboard tab (`/p/{id}/leaderboard`)** – aggregate per-player hit counts, active duration tracking, and first/last hit timestamps derived from the `hits` table.
- **Transcript tab (`/p/{id}/transcript`)** – most recent hit activity first with potential duplicate detection, and the ability to delete individual entries.
- **Settings tab (`/p/{id}/settings`)** – update the total piece count, add general notes, export puzzle data as JSON, and delete the puzzle.
- **Admin panel (`/admin`)** – read-only overview of all puzzles with stats (player count, total hits, timestamps) and database download capability.
- **Real-time updates** – Server-Sent Events stream (`/p/{id}/events`) for live progress synchronization across devices.
- **SQLite persistence** – all puzzle metadata and hits are stored locally so the app can run offline.

The current implementation focuses on the server-rendered flows above. Query-string based sorting/filtering and puzzle image uploads from the design brief are not yet implemented.

## Tech stack

- [FrankenPHP](https://frankenphp.dev/) runtime with the `dunglas/frankenphp:1.9.1-php8.2.29-alpine` base image.
- Embedded [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) server with automatic HTTPS disabled for easy behind-the-proxy deployments (see [`Caddyfile`](./Caddyfile)).
- Plain PHP 8.2 application code with lightweight HTTP/request/response helpers under [`src/`](./src).
- Server-side templates in [`templates/`](./templates) for each tab view.
- SQLite database accessed via PDO; the schema is auto-initialised on first run.

```

## Database schema

Two tables are maintained automatically:

- `puzzles` – puzzle id, name, optional `total_pieces`, optional `notes`, timestamps, and future `image_path` support.
- `hits` – puzzle foreign key, player name, `connection_count`, request IP, user-agent, and timestamps. Individual hits can be deleted via the transcript view, and all hits for a puzzle are removed when the puzzle is deleted.

The default database lives at `var/database.sqlite`. Override with the `JIGSEER_DB_PATH` environment variable if you need to place the file elsewhere.

## Monitoring endpoints

- **`/status`** – simple JSON health check returning `{"status": "ok"}` for uptime monitoring.
- **`/health`** – detailed health check with database connectivity status, application version, and Fly.io environment variables when deployed.

## Local development

Use the built-in PHP development server from the project root:

```bash
php -S 0.0.0.0:8080 -t public
```

By default the app will create `var/database.sqlite`. Set `JIGSEER_DB_PATH` before starting the server to use a different location:

```bash
JIGSEER_DB_PATH=/tmp/jigseer.sqlite php -S 0.0.0.0:8080 -t public
```

## Tests

A small assertion-based test harness verifies the main workflows:

```bash
php tests/run.php
```

The script bootstraps the application against temporary SQLite databases and will exit with a non-zero status on failure.

## Docker usage

Build and run the FrankenPHP image locally:

```bash
docker build -t jigseer:local jigseer
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 jigseer:local
```

The container listens on port 8080 inside the image. Caddy serves static assets from `public/` and forwards dynamic requests to the PHP runtime. HTTPS is deliberately disabled in the container so it can sit behind an external TLS terminator.

## Continuous integration

The [`jigseer` GitHub Actions workflow](../.github/workflows/jigseer.yml) triggers on any change under `jigseer/`. It runs the test harness and, on pushes to the repository, builds and publishes a Docker image to GHCR tagged with both `latest` and the commit SHA.

## Deployment

### Fly.io

The included [`fly.toml`](./fly.toml) provides a ready-to-deploy configuration:

- Uses the prebuilt GHCR image tagged `latest`
- Mounts a persistent 1GB volume at `/data` for the SQLite database
- Configures `JIGSEER_DB_PATH=/data/jigseer.sqlite`
- Auto-stops machines when idle and auto-starts on incoming requests
- Forces HTTPS and runs on port 8080 internally

Deploy with:

```bash
fly deploy
```

### General deployment notes

- Ensure the container has write access to the mounted directory backing `JIGSEER_DB_PATH` (defaults to `/app/var`).
- Provide TLS termination outside the container if the app is exposed publicly.
- Backup the SQLite database regularly if puzzle history matters to your team.
- The `/health` endpoint can be used for container orchestration health checks.
