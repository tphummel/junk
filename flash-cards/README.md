# Flash Cards

This directory contains plain-text flash card decks inspired by the [hashcards](https://borretti.me/article/hashcards-plain-text-spaced-repetition) format. Cards are authored as Markdown with simple cloze deletions (e.g., `{{c1::answer}}`) so they can be fed into Anki or similar spaced-repetition tools.

## Decks included

- `Cards/NATO Phonetic Alphabet.md` – starter deck for the NATO phonetic alphabet.
- `Cards/Units.md` – common measurement units and relationships.
- `Cards/Docker.md` – Docker command-line reminders.
- `Cards/US Presidents.md` – cloze-deletion deck of U.S. presidents, including non-consecutive terms.
- `Cards/Major Metro Airport Codes.md` – major metro airports with their three-letter codes.

Each deck keeps one fact per line to make it easy to parse with text-based tooling.
